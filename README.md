# **Optimal Commercial District Recommendation System**

## **Overview**
Our team implemented a **content-based recommendation system** to suggest the most optimal commercial districts. The project utilizes two distinct methods, combining **cosine similarity**, **category scores**, and advanced techniques like **frequent itemsets** and **association rules** to improve recommendation accuracy.  

## **Methodology**

### **1. Initial System**
- **Cosine Similarity**: Used to measure the similarity between user input and the dataset.  
- **Category Score**: Districts with the **lowest category ratios** were assigned higher scores.  

ðŸ“Š *Results*: The chart on the right illustrates the recommendations produced by this system.  

### **2. Refined System: Leveraging Association Rules**
1. **Transaction Generation**  
2. **Frequent Itemset Extraction**  
3. **Association Rule Generation**  

## **Final Report Generation**
Once an **optimal commercial district** is determined, the system generates an **analytical report** containing:
- Key district information  
- Visualized statistics
